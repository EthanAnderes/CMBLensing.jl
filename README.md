# CMBLensing.jl

This repository contains tools written in the [Julia](https://julialang.org/) language to analyze the gravitationally lensed Cosmic Microwave Background, and includes an implementation of the `LenseFlow`  algorithm as described in [Millea, Anderes, & Wandelt (2017)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.06753). 


## Installation

```julia
Pkg.clone("https://github.com/marius311/CMBLensing.jl")
```

## Documentation

Documentation is a work-in-progress, but see the [128x128 example](nb/jointmax_128example/jointmax_128example.ipynb) mentioned in our paper which serves as an example of the code capabilities.
